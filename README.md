You should `NOT` copy paste the code to this repo instead do this:

2. Copy the links of the both PRs
3. Open a PR here and leave as a comment both links

Backend project is a team project so:

1. Fork the repo you have been working with.
2. for instance if you are in team 5 you would fork the [forked repo](https://github.com/arf1e/team-5-backend/tree/main)
3. then go to [fs16-backend](https://github.com/Integrify-Finland/fs16-backend)
4. Open a PR -> compate across forks -> choose your repo.
